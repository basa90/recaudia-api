			<div class="p">There are two important situations where you might have trouble with timeouts:<ul class="ul" id="loio02ef39f70a244c7cb0cb4d65be6ae396__ul_lrm_pzv_kx">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">When loading your app</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">When trying to find <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> controls in the app</p>

					</li>

				</ul>
</div>

			<div class="p">When loading the app, the OPA5 command can accept a second parameter, which is the number of seconds to wait for the application to load.
				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js"><samp class="ph codeph">#!js</samp>var opa5 = new Opa5();
opa5.iStartMyAppInAFrame("path/to/your/app.html", 30); // wait time in seconds</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">You can set the following OPA5 setting to cause OPA5 to wait a different amount of time for a control to become available on the
				screen:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js"><samp class="ph codeph">#!js</samp>sap.ui.test.Opa.config.timeout = 20; // wait time in seconds</pre></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Who should write feature files?</div><div type="Who should write feature files?">
			
			<p class="p">Ideally, the Product Owner (PO) develops feature files in collaboration with developers. Depending on the PO's level of comfort, they can upload the
				feature files directly to source control, or let the developers take care of that.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">When writing the step definitions, the feature file is inadequate! What to do?</div><div type="When writing the step definitions, the feature file is inadequate! What to do?">
			
			<p class="p">You will usually find that there is a gap between what the PO has written, and the information that the developer requires to implement an
				integration test. It's ok for the developer to modify the feature file to enable testing, as long as they check back with the PO to ensure that
				the feature file is still correct.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Every time the PO modifies the feature file it breaks the tests: what can we do about this?</div><div type="Every time the PO modifies the feature file it breaks the tests: what can we do about this?">
			
			<p class="p">Actually, this is the point of Gherkin. When modifications to a feature file are uploaded to source control, we expect this to break existing
				tests, as it should, since the application's expected behavior has changed—but the application itself has not changed yet. Gherkin is forcing
				the application to stay in sync with the feature file. Consider that this also encourages you to be more honest about accepting new feature
				changes into your product—and the amount of extra work that this entails. We recommend that you use your formal code review process to allow
				developers to change the application and fix the tests, and then submit all the new code together with the feature file changes at the same time
				into the master branch.</p>
