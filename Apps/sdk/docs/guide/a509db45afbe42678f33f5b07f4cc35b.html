	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">For behavior-driven development with Gherkin, you should know the following advanced concepts.</p>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Tags</div><div type="Tags">
			
			<div class="p">Gherkin supports the concept of tags. A tag is meta-data that can augment a feature or scenario with contextual information. Tags begin with an @ symbol,
				appear on the line above a feature or scenario, and are delimited by
				spaces.<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!feature</samp>@lemmings
Feature: Clicking Buttons Is a Life Saving Activity

  @saved @button
  Scenario: Click a button, save a life!
    Then  I save a lemming's life
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">Tags on features are inherited by all of its scenarios. So in the above feature file, the scenario has three tags:
					<samp class="ph codeph">@lemmings</samp>,<samp class="ph codeph">@saved</samp>, and <samp class="ph codeph">@button</samp>. Tags have a number of potentially interesting uses:<ul class="ul" id="loioa509db45afbe42678f33f5b07f4cc35b__ul_uvx_l55_kx">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Tags can be used like a category to create collections of features or scenarios, for example: <samp class="ph codeph">@sales</samp> or
								<samp class="ph codeph">@human-resources</samp>.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Tags can be used to refer to numbered documents, for example: <samp class="ph codeph">@BCP-1234567890</samp>.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Tags can refer to the stage of the development process for that feature, for example: <samp class="ph codeph">@requirements</samp>,
								<samp class="ph codeph">@development</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">@testing</samp>.</p>

					</li>

				</ul>
</div>

			<p class="p">Tags generally help to understand the feature file. There is, however, one <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">exception</span>: the <samp class="ph codeph">@wip</samp> tag. This tag
				indicates to the Gherkin test harness that it should skip that test during test execution. A skipped test is not executed and passes
				automatically. The special <samp class="ph codeph">@wip</samp> tag is intended to be used when you're in the middle of implementing the tests for a feature
				file. You can also use it on scenarios or features that you have no intention of testing. Here's an example of a test execution with a skipped
				test: </p>

			<div class="fig fignone" id="loioa509db45afbe42678f33f5b07f4cc35b__fig_pgh_2v5_kx"><div class="figcontainer">

			</div></div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Background scenarios</div><div type="Background scenarios">
			
			<div class="p">When writing a feature file, some test steps might need to be executed for every scenario. In particular, the test step that loads the app is very
				frequently repeated for each test scenario.
				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!feature</samp>Feature: Clicking Buttons Is a Life Saving Activity

  Scenario: Click a button, save a life!
    Given I have started the app
    Then I save a lemming's life

  Scenario: The saved lemming has a name
    Given I have started the app
    Then I see Alice at the end of the list</pre></div>
In
				this case, you can consolidate all of the repeated steps into a single special scenario called a "background scenario", which uses the keyword
					<samp class="ph codeph">Background</samp>. The test steps in the background scenario get executed at the beginning of every other scenario in the feature
				file. For example, the following feature file is equivalent to the one shown above:
				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!feature</samp>Feature: Clicking Buttons Is a Life Saving Activity

  Background:
    Given I have started the app

  Scenario: Click a button, save a life!
    Then I save a lemming's life

  Scenario: The saved lemming has a name
    Then I see Alice at the end of the list</pre></div>
</div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Step arguments and regular expressions</div><div type="Step arguments and regular expressions">
			
			<div class="p">When writing feature file test steps, you might end up in a situation where test steps are frequently repeated, but with a slight variation between each
				step.<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!feature</samp>Scenario: Save one lemming
  When I click on the life saving button 1 time
  Then I see Alice at the end of the list of saved lemmings

Scenario: Save two lemmings
  When I click on the life saving button 2 times
  Then I see Bob at the end of the list of saved lemmings</pre></div>
</div>

			<p class="p">If you were to write a steps file for the above feature file, in the worst case you might have to write four separate step definitions. The problem would
				only get worse if you needed to write more scenarios. However, using step arguments you can consolidate the four step definitions into only two
				step definitions (written here in pseudo-code):</p>

			<p class="p">I click on the life saving button X time(s)</p>

			<p class="p">I see &lt;NAME&gt; at the end of the list of saved lemmings </p>

			<div class="p">How does this work in real JavaScript code? When you write the step definition's regular expression, you can use a regular expression concept called
				"capturing groups" to specify arguments to extract from the natural language of the test step. If you've never worked with regular expressions
				before, there is definitely a learning curve here, but it's a really powerful tool that is worth learning. These capturing groups will be passed
				to the test function as parameters (of type <samp class="ph codeph">string</samp>) that you can name whatever you want. Continuing the example above, here are
				the step definitions you could
				write:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js"><samp class="ph codeph">#!js</samp>this.register(
  /^I click on the life saving button (\d+) times?$/i,
  function(sNumTimes) {}
);

this.register(
  /^I see (.*?) at the end of the list of saved lemmings$/i,
  function(sName) {}
);
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
				<p class="p">All parameters extracted from capturing groups are of the JavaScript type string. Hence, you will need to use (for example)
						<samp class="ph codeph">parseInt</samp> to convert numbers into type <samp class="ph codeph">int</samp> before you do a numerical comparison.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="p">Here are a few regular expression concepts that are especially useful in
				Gherkin:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js"><samp class="ph codeph">#!js</samp>(.*?) – captures any text into a parameter
(\d+) – captures any number into a parameter
\s* - will match 0 or more spaces
s? – will match the character "s" if it's there (replace "s" with any character)
(text)? – will capture "text" into a parameter if it's there
(?:text)? – will match "text" if it's there, without capturing into a parameter
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
				<p class="p">A common pitfall in regular expressions is that many characters are reserved and have a special meaning, in particular backslash
						(<samp class="ph codeph">\</samp>), period (<samp class="ph codeph">.</samp>), asterisk (<samp class="ph codeph">*</samp>), plus (<samp class="ph codeph">+</samp>), dash (<samp class="ph codeph">-</samp>)
					and braces (<samp class="ph codeph">[]</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">()</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">{}</samp>). Put the backslash character in front of a special character
					to escape it so it is treated as plain text, for example: <samp class="ph codeph">\- </samp>or <samp class="ph codeph">\+</samp>. If your regular expression contains
					multiple parameters, then they will be passed to the test function in the same order as they appear in the regular expression.</p>

				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js"><samp class="ph codeph">#!js</samp>this.register(
  /^I click (\d+) times and see (.*?) at the end of the list$/i,
  function(sNumTimes, sName) {}
);</pre></div>

			</div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Context</div><div type="Context">
			
			<div class="p">Imagine that you have the following feature file
				scenario:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!feature</samp>Scenario: some steps depend on each other
  Given I have a Latte Cappuccino in front of me
  When I drink the coffee
  Then I feel less sleepy
</pre></div>
</div>

			<p class="p">Trying to implement the step definitions might be a bit challenging because in the second step,<samp class="ph codeph"> I drink the coffee</samp>, there is no mention
				of which coffee. Sometimes, to make a feature file sound more natural, or just to reduce repetition, it can be beneficial to retain the context
				from one test step to the next. Fortunately, Gherkin makes this easy.</p>

			<div class="p">In Gherkin, the JavaScript <samp class="ph codeph">this</samp> variable is unique for each scenario. Hence, any variables assigned to one step definition can be used in
				any subsequently executed step definitions within the same scenario. Every new scenario in the feature will start with a fresh
					<samp class="ph codeph">this</samp> object. As a result, we could implement the above feature file's step definitions like
				so:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js"><samp class="ph codeph">#!js</samp>this.register(/^I have a (.*?) in front of me$/i, function(coffeeType) {
  this.coffeeType = coffeeType;
});

this.register(/^I drink the coffee$/i, function() {
  this.sleepinessBefore = user.getSleepiness();
  user.drink(this.coffeeType);
});

this.register(/^I feel less sleepy$/i, function() {
  Opa5.assert.ok(user.getSleepiness() &lt; this.sleepinessBefore, "Verified...");
});
</pre></div>
</div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Data tables</div><div type="Data tables">
			
			<div class="p">There might be times when you want to use a large amount of structured data in your test. For this, you can use a concept called a data table. In a
				feature file, a data table is placed underneath a test step and is composed of rows and columns, with rows delimited by new lines, and columns
				surrounded by the pipe (<samp class="ph codeph">|</samp>)
				character.<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!feature</samp>Scenario: lots of data
  Given I see the following lemmings:
    | Name    | Age in Months | Role         |
    | Alice   | 24            | Support      |
    | Bob     | 70            |              |
    | Charlie | 120           | Stories      |
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">In the steps file, if a data table is included in the test scenario then an extra parameter will be passed at the end of the step definition function
				(after any step arguments that appear in the regular
				expression).<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js"><samp class="ph codeph">#!js</samp>this.register(
  /^I see the following (.*?):$/i,
  function(sAnimalType, aDataTable) {}
);
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">Data tables are usually passed to the test function as a two-dimensional array (an array of arrays). For example, the above feature file data table would
				produce the following array in variable <samp class="ph codeph">aDataTable</samp> at
				runtime:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!feature</samp>[
  ["Name", "Age in Months", "Role"],
  ["Alice", "24", "Support"],
  ["Bob", "70", ""],
  ["Charlie", "120", "Stories"]
]
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">If the feature file data was a single row or a single column, then the test function will receive a simple array instead of a two-dimensional
				array.<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!feature</samp>Scenario: lots of data

  Given I see the following lemmings:
    | Alice   |
    | Bob     |
    | Charlie |

  And I see the following lemmings:
    | Alice | Bob | Charlie |
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">Both test steps will provide the following runtime value for
				<samp class="ph codeph">aDataTable</samp>:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js"><samp class="ph codeph">#!js</samp> ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]</pre></div>
</div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Data table utilities</div><div type="Data table utilities">
			
			<div class="p">The contents of the data table in the feature file are sent to the step definition function in a raw form, with no modification. This raw format is often
				useful, however, sometimes a different format would be more helpful. Fortunately, there is a Gherkin namespace called
					<samp class="ph codeph">dataTableUtils</samp> that makes this reformatting task easy. This namespace provides several utilities that might come in handy,
				including the function <samp class="ph codeph">toTable</samp>, which transforms the two-dimensional array into a simple array of objects. In the array of
				objects, each object's attribute names are derived from the header line in the table. For example, consider the following feature
				file:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!feature</samp>Scenario: lots of data
  Given I see the following lemmings:
    | Name    | Age in Months | Role         |
    | Alice   | 24            | Support      |
    | Bob     | 70            |              |
    | Charlie | 120           | Stories      |
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">And the following steps
				file:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!js</samp>this.register(
  /^I see the following lemmings:$/i, function(aRawData) {
    var aData = dataTableUtils.toTable(aRawData, "camelCase");
  }
);
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">In the above steps code, we ask the <samp class="ph codeph">dataTableUtils</samp> to use camel case when setting the names of the object attributes. For those familiar
				with coding conventions, camel case transforms the string "Hello World" into <samp class="ph codeph">helloWorld</samp>. During runtime, the variable
					<samp class="ph codeph">aData</samp> will be assigned the following
				value:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js"><samp class="ph codeph">#!js</samp> [
  {
    ageInMonths: "24"
    name: "Alice"
    role: "Support"
  },
  {
    ageInMonths: "70"
    name: "Bob"
    role: ""
  },
  {
    ageInMonths: "120"
    name: "Charlie"
    role: "Stories"
  }
]
</pre></div>
</div>

			<p class="p">In this <samp class="ph codeph">toTable</samp> format, the data is now easier to work with. There are other transformation functions and normalization
				functions available. <span class="ph">For more information, see <a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.test.gherkin.html" alt="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.test.gherkin.html" title="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.test.gherkin.html">API Reference: <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.test.gherkin</samp></a>.</span>
				</p>

			<div class="p">If you have specialized normalization needs, it is also possible to create your own normalization function. This is simply a function that accepts a
				single string parameter and returns a string. You could pass your custom normalization function into a <samp class="ph codeph">toTable</samp> call (for
				example), like
				this:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js"><samp class="ph codeph">#!js</samp>var aData = dataTableUtils.toTable(aRawData, function(s) {
  return dataTableUtils.normalization.camelCase(s).replace("role", "job");
});
</pre></div>
</div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Scenario outlines</div><div type="Scenario outlines">
			
			<div class="p">Sometimes you need to test a repeating pattern of steps. For
				example:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!feature</samp>Scenario: Save 1 Lemming
  When I click on the life saving button 1 time
  Then I see Alice at the end of the list of saved lemmings

Scenario: Save 2 Lemmings
  When I click on the life saving button 2 times
  Then I see Bob at the end of the list of saved lemmings

Scenario: Save 3 Lemmings
  When I click on the life saving button 3 times
  Then I see Charlie at the end of the list of saved lemmings
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">Step arguments will make it easier to implement this in the steps file, but what about in the feature file itself? The constant repetition looks awful and
				is difficult to maintain. The solution is to use a scenario outline. With a scenario outline, you can write the above test scenarios only once,
				and during test execution Gherkin will actually execute the test as many times as you like, for whatever input examples you have given. Here's
				how it looks in the feature
				file:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode"><samp class="ph codeph">#!feature</samp>Scenario Outline: Using a scenario outline to Save Lemmings
  When I click on the life saving button &lt;NUM CLICKS&gt; times
  Then I see &lt;NAME&gt; at the end of the list of saved lemmings

Examples: list of lemmings
  | NUM CLICKS | NAME     |
  |  1         |  Alice   |
  |  2         |  Bob     |
  |  3         |  Charlie |
</pre></div>
</div>

			<p class="p">The above <samp class="ph codeph">Scenario Outline</samp> is equivalent to writing out the three scenarios individually. In the above feature file, <samp class="ph codeph">NUM
					CLICKS</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">NAME</samp> are called "placeholders". At test execution, these placeholders get automatically replaced by the
				values in the examples table. For each row in the <samp class="ph codeph">Examples</samp> one new test scenario will be generated. </p>

			<div class="p">Also keep in mind the following details:<ul class="ul" id="loioa509db45afbe42678f33f5b07f4cc35b__ul_ftn_hhv_kx">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Placeholders are case-sensitive, and can use spaces or punctuation</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Each placeholder found in the <samp class="ph codeph">Scenario Outline</samp> requires one column in the <samp class="ph codeph">Examples</samp> table, with the
